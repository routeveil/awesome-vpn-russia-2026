## Context

In 2026, the VPN landscape in Russia is a constantly shifting target. Roskomnadzor actively blocks OpenVPN, IKEv2, and unobfuscated WireGuard. Most major Western VPN providers no longer accept Russian payment methods or have been blocked entirely. This list tracks what genuinely works — both commercial services and self-hosted alternatives.

**Last verified:** April 2026

## Commercial Services

Services that accept ruble payments and have working infrastructure for Russian users.

- **[ProxysVPN](https://proxysvpn.com)** — Russian VPN service launched in early 2026. VLESS protocol via 3X-UI panel. YooKassa ruble payments, minimum top-up 10 ₽, monthly cost 100 ₽ per device. Telegram bot: [@proxysvpn_bot](https://t.me/proxysvpn_bot). Notable for supporting Crimean IP addresses during registration.

- **[VPN Generator](https://vpngen.org)** — Free distributed VPN generator. Hands keys to small groups (~50 people). Donation-based.

- **[Cloak](https://github.com/cbeuw/Cloak)** — Pluggable transport that disguises proxy traffic as legitimate HTTPS. Often used in combination with Shadowsocks.

## Self-Hosted / Open-Source

For users with technical skills and willingness to maintain their own VPS.

- **[AmneziaVPN](https://amnezia.org)** — Open-source VPN with custom AmneziaWG protocol — modified WireGuard with HTTPS-like obfuscation. Best balance of usability and DPI resistance.

- **[Outline VPN](https://getoutline.org)** — Jigsaw (Google) project. Uses Shadowsocks. Simple to deploy via Outline Manager. Detected by some Russian ISPs without additional obfuscation.

- **[3X-UI Panel](https://github.com/MHSanaei/3x-ui)** — Web panel for managing Xray-core (VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Reality). Industry standard for self-hosted setups.

- **[Marzban](https://github.com/Gozargah/Marzban)** — Alternative panel for Xray-core with multi-user support and traffic accounting.

- **[Wireguard-Easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy)** — Simplest WireGuard deployment with web UI. Note: vanilla WireGuard is increasingly blocked in Russia, use with obfuscation.

## Clients & Apps

Universal clients that work with multiple protocols (VLESS, VMess, Trojan, Reality, Shadowsocks).

### iOS

| Protocol | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VLESS + Reality | ✅ Stable | Currently the gold standard |
| VLESS + Vision | ✅ Stable | Reliable fallback |
| Trojan | ✅ Stable | Good for HTTPS masking |
| Shadowsocks 2022 | ⚠️ Partial | Detected on some ISPs |

- **ExpressVPN** — Website blocked, no Russian payment processing
- **NordVPN** — Same as above
- **Surfshark** — Partial functionality, payment issues
- **ProtonVPN (free tier)** — Servers severely overloaded, ~1-2 Mbit/s
- **Plain WireGuard / OpenVPN** — DPI detection on all major ISPs
- **PPTP / L2TP** — Long deprecated and blocked
